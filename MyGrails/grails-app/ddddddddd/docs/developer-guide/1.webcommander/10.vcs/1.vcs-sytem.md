* **Master** : Always will be stable with latest codes
* **Release Branch (3.0.0)**: It's created according release, when we sign off a version
* **Development**: This is the pre master branch, which is identical clone of a master, but here can rebase/merge Operational branches for integration test,
all operational branch always rebase with this branch.
* **Operational Branch (PDWC-X)**: This is the branch which is specially for temporary use, when we start work on an issue 
we have to create a branch from JIRA (from Development branch) and checkout by IDEA/Editor and start work there and continuously push to branch.
