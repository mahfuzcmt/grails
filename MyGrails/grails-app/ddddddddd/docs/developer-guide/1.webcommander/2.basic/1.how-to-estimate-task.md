#### How to Estimate Task time require?

<br><br>

**Oh no!!**, Estimation is really tricky part, if anyone can make it perfectly then we can say he/she will pass better time
in development, if not able to estimate perfectly then it will make personal stress, and also team stress. It can be make
team deadline failure, so we have to more careful when we making our estimation.

#### Estimation Element or check list consideration.

* **Read the Requirement carefully** : 
* **Check Logical things such as flowchart, algorithm** :
* **Breakdown task into major part** : 
* **Breakdown Major part into working task** : 
* **Find System Difficulties** : 
     * **UI** :
     * **JS** :
     * **Grails/Groovy/Java** :
* **Task Difficulties** :
     * **Is API** :
         * **Authentication** :
         * **End Point** :
     * **Impact with Other** :  
* **Find Similarities in System** : 
* **Partial Testing Plan** :

#### How to prevent Estimation Failure?

* **Breakdown task into module**: 
* **Test Condition and IO**: 
* **Don't think QA will find your bug**: 
* **Right Time Right Flag (RTRF)**:
