### How to Start Development Task?

<br> 

**Just Do It !!!** Sometimes development like this, sometimes not. It's depending what type of task we are doing, if it
bug fix or hot fix then like **Just Do It**, but if task like Implementation of **new feature** or Improvement of a **feature**
then we have to think first and make a plan then start work.

#### Guidelines 

* **Strictly follow the [how to estimate task lists](/webcommander/basic/how-to-estimate-task/)**
* **If logical plan failed then need to reimplement whole thing, so validate logic with related task**
* **DRY (Don't repeat yourself)**: Before start work need to find similar implementation this reduce huge time.
* **Create a branch from JIRA and then checkout into local and start work**
* **Keep in mind GIT branching is worst thing if we not rebase it properly**: if conflict happen then it can suck our whole estimation time, so careful about **[rebase](/webcommander/vcs/vcs-sytem/)** 
* **Test own code with all possible aspect so that QA can't find bug** : If QA find some bug and report it, sometimes it make big disaster such as we may need to restructure our code, so **dev careful about test**
* **Prepare Completion and Impact Note**: Must need to provide impact of code so that QA can test those are we changed for that task.
